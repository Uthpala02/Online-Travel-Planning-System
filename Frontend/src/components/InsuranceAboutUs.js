            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Timonth Clauss, the current President and CEO of United Public Adjusters(UPA) has been leading the organization since 2019. Under Tim's leadership, UPA has expanded into an additional 8 states, with more coming aboard every Month. Tim also has over been responsible for the UPA to be the first non-profit public adjusting firm in the United States. Tim is committed to serving the public in UPA's educational programs, Project Restore and Operation Fire safety, two of the most successful programs in UPA's history. With additional sponsored programs like Restaurant Rescue Program, Business Owner Rescue Program, Sellers Advantage, Landlord Advantage, and Loyal Christian Housing Advantage, there are plenty of opportunities to assist a lot of folks and help them recover from major storm events. Tim runs the company on the basic principle of your word is your bond as when you give your word you must honor it as if it were to God and always do your best. Tim always preaches that our clients are hurting, we have to help, and he uses that drive and determination to lead UPA across the US with an eye on Worldwide expansion.
               As Tim has always stated, "People need our services all over the World". And with this since UPA never takes a penny directly out of the client's pocket or asked the client to write a check. It is no wonder the non-profit has seen such rapid expansion. This is a direct result of the need for Public Adjusting services not only in the United States but on a worldwide scope. UPA has committed to being the public adjusting company of choice for anyone who has suffered property damage and they feel they haven't received enough money from their insurance company to repair the damages.

          <h3>How Insurance works</h3>
         <p>A multitude of different types of insurance policies is available, and virtually any individual or business can find an insurance company willing to insure themâ€”for a price. The most common types of personal insurance policies are auto, health, homeowners, and life. Most individuals in the United States have at least one of these types of insurance, and car insurance is required by law.</p>
